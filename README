Hi fellow learners!!

This is a study guide made prior to me taking the RB189 interview assessment.

I have included an article about my experience with the project which includes some tips and tricks called `Project_tips`.

Many of the questions in the mock interview questions file are taken from past quizzes in 175, 180 & 185 and therefore property of LS. I have chosen not to include answers to these questions. All of the answers can be found in past quizzes, lectures, recommended additional readings within the course and within my own reading recommendations found in `helpful_reading.md`. (happy hunting ^^) I highly recommend doing the past quizzes from 175, 180 and 185.

The questions regarding the project are purely speculation, but be be able to explain your project thoroughly and succinctly.

Prepare for the interview with the intent of teaching the content found in 175, 180 & 185. It may be beneficial to read up on articles for the OOP interview as the format may be similar.

Best of luck and hopefully this study guide will be of some use ^^

Happy learning!!
