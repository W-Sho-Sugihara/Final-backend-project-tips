Hi fellow learners!!

This is a study guide made prior to me taking the RB189 interview assessment.

I have included an article about my experience with the project which includes some tips and tricks called `Project_tips`.

Many of the questions in the mock interview questions file are taken from past quizzes in 175, 180 & 185 and therefore property of LS. I have chosen not to include answers to these questions. All of the answers can be found in past quizzes, lectures or recommended additional readings within the course. (happy hunting ^^) I highly recommend doing the past quizzes from 175, 180 and 185.

The questions regarding the project are purely speculation. I might be completely off target as to what they might ask.

Best of luck and hopefully this study guide will be of some use ^^

Happy learning!!
