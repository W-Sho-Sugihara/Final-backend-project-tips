Hi fellow learners!!

This is a study guide made prior to me taking the RB189 interview assessment. Many of the questions and answers are taken from past quizzes in 175, 180 & 185 and therefore property of LS. Some answers are my personal answers and/or notes, but either way use your own words when answering. ^^
Also, there are some questions in the quizzes that I had forgotten the answer to and therefore included in the study guide, but probaly wont be asked questions about during the interview (eg. questions about heroku and Procfiles). I highly recommend doing the past quizzes from 175, 180 and 185.

The questions regarding the project are purely speculation. I might be completely off target as to what they might ask as I am going into the interview blind. (This is a newer assessment at the time of writing this and therefore have not found an upperclassman from whom I can glean information.)

Best of luck and hopefully this study guide will be of some use ^^

Happy learning!!
