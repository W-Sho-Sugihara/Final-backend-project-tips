- In what ways did you use sessions?

- What were some challenges you faced when querying data from the DB to be later displayed on your app?

- Did you use any custom classes (other than database_persistence)? What were their uses?

- What kind of values did your methods from '@storage' or from your database_persistence class return? single values, hashes, custom class obj's, arrays, etc? why did you choose the return value type that you did?
